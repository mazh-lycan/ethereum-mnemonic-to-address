# Paper Wallet

This script allows to generate locally all the following information given a mnemonic:

- Private key
- Public key
- Compressed public key
- Address
- Keystore

## INSTALLATION

(Tool created using Node v18.16.0)

Run `npm install` on *keystoreGenerator*
Run `node  .\keystoreGenerator.js` on *keystoreGenerator/generator*

## USE CASES

This script may be useful for the following use cases:

- IF EXECUTED EXCLUSIVELY LOCALLY: 
    - Generate a paper wallet, that's it a wallet which seed phrase has never been uploaded anywhere and it is kept safe, to send tokens to the correspondant address. Similar to a Cold Wallet but less fancy. 
    - In case of using Metamask and wanting to use a different address from the one stored there, and only knowing the seed of your new wallet, you can generate the private key with this script to load it on the extension.
